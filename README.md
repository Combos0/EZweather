# EZweather

This project is a simple weather app.
Plug in a city and get the local weather
of that city. The main focus of this is 
having to work with asynchronous code and
API's since I have not yet worked with 
anything like this before.


TODO:

1. Connect the fetched values to something
on the screen.

2. Make sure the fetched data pulls the correct
city. See about adding aditional fields for
country or even state.
